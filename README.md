## Explanation Helper 

- This is a model explanation helper with GUI, which is a revision and an extension of the course project from the seminar Klassifikation und Clustering.

- I implemented the GUI with Streamlit for explaining a text classification model locally with different approaches. Some basic model evaluations with a test dataset given are included as well.

- Training is not a part of this prototype-level app, but it has been done in the original course work in .ipynb format, which is also in the repository. For simplicity, a fine-tuned model will be directly imported from HuggingFace.
